Read rom + print instructions
- Rom class that reads rom data into buffer
- extract name,type
- return instructions as buffer

Debug
- Hookup arrow buttons to run cpu
- - '>' call step
- - '>>' run indefinately
- - - Run cpu in separate thread - so ui can update
- - - allow pause button to stop run, so step can be done again

- RenderWindow holds thread + runs cpu inside it?
- - need a way to communicate between render window + cpu
- - CpuManager class that holds the thread
- - - function to add MsgAction (pause/run/step/break points) - adds to pending list with mutex lock
- - - thread loop that is calling step checks msgAction - lock pending list with mutex + processes all pending messages
